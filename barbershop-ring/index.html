    <h1>ring ring ring: how to sing in the barbershop style</h1>

<hr/>

<p><em>This post is meant to be accessible to those with no music theory background, with bonus information for people who know more about music theory. Also, I’m not an expert on this. There’s depth and complexity to this topic that won’t be explored here. Accuracy not guaranteed.</em></p>

<p>After a dozen years singing in choirs, I recently joined <a href="https://www.fogcityharmonia.org/">a barbershop chorus</a>. One of my first questions was, “What <em>is</em> barbershop? Like, what makes this different from a regular choir?” Just like opera, jazz, and musical theater all sound different, barbershop has a different sound than conventional choral music. I’ve learned that its defining qualities include: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>a capella</strong>, i.e. only voices and no instrumental accompaniment</li>
<li><strong>tight harmonies</strong>, i.e. the notes being sung are closer together in pitch instead of super high and super low notes being sung at the same time (more specifically, they almost never spread further than an octave and a half, with the inner two voices overlapping and swapping notes)</li>
<li>lots of <strong>dominant seventh chords</strong> (if you don’t know music theory, don’t worry about this one)</li>
<li><strong>ring</strong>, which means the voices sound kind of sparkly</li>
</ul>

<p>
The first three of these are determined by how the sheet music is composed, but ring is something singers have to add themselves. I’ve been learning how to help my voice have more ring, more sparkle, and I want to share with you what I’ve learned so far.</p>

<h3>what are overtones?</h3>

<p>As it turns out, “ring” comes from accentuating overtones. But what are overtones?
</p><p>
The first thing you need to know is all musical instruments (e.g. piano, viola, voice, trumpet) work by vibrating something, like a string or a column of air (or both!). These vibrations move through the air between the instrument and your ear, eventually vibrating little hairs in your ear which is how you hear sound.
</p><p>
The second thing you need to know is that when strings or columns or air vibrate at a particular pitch, those vibrations interact with themselves to create more pitches. A piano string vibrating at 110Hz also vibrates at twice that speed (220Hz, an octave higher), three times (330Hz), four times, five times, and so on. This is called the <em>harmonic series</em>.
</p>

<p>
  You don’t need to fully understand this — the main point is that all notes you hear are actually a collection of several notes in exactly perfect ratio with each other, and your brain parses it as just one note which is the lowest note of the set and called the <em>fundamental</em>.
</p><p>
Your brain doesn’t just ignore the higher overtones though. The overtones tell your brain what instrument it’s listening to, because every instrument has different loudnesses of different overtones. Hooty instruments like flutes produce louder lower overtones and quieter higher overtones. More twangy instruments like banjos produce louder higher overtones. The relative loudness of each overtone in the harmonic series determines what sound quality a note has, which is often called its color or <em>timbre</em>. (<a href="https://youtu.be/Wx_kugSemfY?si=SBXNhqsyQXUfmuBy&t=342">This video</a> has some fun examples of this.)
</p><p>
So when I want to sing in a particular style, I need to figure out how to shape the air columns of my instrument — i.e. move around my mouth, nose, and throat — to change which overtones are louder in order to produce that style of sound. And the ring of barbershop style involves getting several overtones pretty loud. The sparkling sound is the barely audible higher notes floating in perfect ratio above the fundamental notes that the barbershoppers are singing.</p>

<h3>creating ring as an individual singer</h3>
<p>
  So how do you produce those louder overtones? One of the easiest ways to think about this is vowel shape. One of my favorite overtone facts is that different vowels sound different for exactly the same reason various instruments sound different — it’s literally only a difference in which overtones are louder. “Hooty” vowels like “oo” have louder lower overtones and quieter higher overtones. More twangy vowels like “ee” have louder higher overtones. Singing different vowels on the same note will have the same fundamental pitch, so the only difference is the loudness of the overtones.
  </p><p>
Here are some screenshots from me singing with an app called <a href="https://www.tonalenergy.com/te-mobile">TE Tuner</a>. It shows how loud the fundamental is in purple and the green bars show how loud each note in the harmonic series is. The screenshots are from a video of me singing several different vowels (which you can watch here too), so you can see how they have different distributions of overtones.</p>

<p>
  In barbershop we try to sing any vowel closer to an “ee” sound, sort of like singing with an accent. It’s hard sometimes to give instructions to change the shape of the vocal instrument, since it’s a pretty complicated instrument that we can’t see, so we often use metaphors and experiment until we figure out what feels right. In barbershop we say to “sing bright” or “sing forward in the mouth” or “place the sound in your nose” or (especially for those trained to sing more of a hooty choir sound) “sing more like you’re speaking”.
  </p><p>
Here’s a video showing how overtones change as I change the timbre of a vowel:</p>

<h3>creating ring as an ensemble</h3>
<p>When multiple people sing barbershop together, there are strategies they can use to enhance their collective ring. Tuning and matching vowel shape are both very important for overtones to be able to overlap and reinforce each other. The more singers create the same timbre of sound and the more they sing in tune together, the more their overtones overlap, and the closer a listener’s brain gets to hearing a single instrument with the “barbershop timbre” instead of a collection of different voices. It’s especially important that the basses (the lowermost voice part) produce louder overtones, because the higher voices will often sing notes that overlap the overtones of the basses, which contributes to this cohesive sound.
  </p><p>
One last note on tuning: it’s quite important in barbershop singing to use <em>just intonation</em>.
</p><p>
Pianos use a different tuning system called <em>equal temperament</em> where any two strings beside each other are tuned to be equally close together. This is helpful for playing songs in different keys without having to retune the piano, but the notes are chosen for their distance from each other (measured in <em>cents</em>, logarithmic to Hz) instead of their ratios with each others’ frequencies (frequency is measured in Hz). Since piano notes played at the same time don’t have frequencies that are in perfect ratio with each other, the overtones don’t overlap and produce ring.
</p><p>
Singing, like most orchestral instruments, is different because you can more easily adjust the tuning of individual pitches as they are sung or played. Singing in <em>just intonation</em> means adjusting the tuning of a note in live time depending on the chord they’re sung in, so that the frequencies of the notes in a chord have cleaner ratios with each other. This tends to sound nicer in general, but is especially important for barbershop where we want overtones to line up and create collective ring.</p>
