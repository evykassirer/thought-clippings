<h3>tell us about it! why do you like this park? share a story if you fancy</h3>

<p class="park-title"><strong>buena vista</strong></p>

<div>
  <p>it's wild to me that i live near a whole-ass hike in the middle of an urban city. i can walk up and get out of breath, i can be surrounded by trees and barely see any cars or buildings. i love picking blackberries there, getting high there, walking through when the sun is low and peeking through the trees. what a treasure.</p>
  <p>So many different types of trees, excellent views, always fairly empty/not busy, doesn’t even feel like you’re in a city!</p>
  <p>Buena Vista’s forests feel like another world. The steep hill and lack of open meadows means it’s never crowded, plus there’s the all-time view from the top of course.</p>

<p class="park-title"><strong>golden gate park</strong></p>

<p>I went on dates with my wife here</p>
<p>Running on JFK in the morning is so wholesome</p>
<p>big</p>
<p>The variety and ability to explore on foot and bike </p>
</div>

<p class="park-title"><strong>The one with the golden entrance</strong></p>

<p>It's explorable and the spirit life in its present state of beauty the super natural come to a noticeable boiling point and the truth is told about the vail and our multi dimensional excestanc is then un folded to see to the center and love is then held like it should be signed Damien George Portoghese no harm in my light.</p>
