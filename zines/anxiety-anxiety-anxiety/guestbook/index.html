<p>Came across at Santa Rosa Zinefest and could tell flipping thru that it was something I needed. “hit da bricks” esp, because I recently found the psychic wherewithal to quit a job that had structured my life since b4 the pandemic. As for what now? I think “do scary shit”, “ask for what you want”, “every choice feels wrong”, “motivations other than fear”…well, I guess the whole zine will be a standby:) Thx evy!!!</p>

<p>Took the words out of my brain! Anxiety for me has been a pain staking process of self-education, given how little these topics are discussed. I only wish I had read this zine 5 or 6 years ago to maybe stave off a few panic attacks, but am nonetheless deeply grateful for and validated by the author.</p>

<p>I read it last night and I really appreciate and respect what you are working on and sharing in your life. Your writing is clear personal and engaging. I found I couldn't stop until I read it all. Hope you keep working at it and share it with others. I'm pretty sure it will help others who are struggling with anxiety and touch them in a way that sometimes professionals don't.</p>

<p>Zines I've previously read were personal art/ poetry focused, but this one turned out to be a really helpful general guide to anxiety. I got a couple of great tips, like reframing your fears as positive motivations. I appreciate the time and care that was put into making each piece short, sweet, and personable with clear takeaways, meow.</p>
